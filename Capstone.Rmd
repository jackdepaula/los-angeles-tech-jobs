2017 Employment by major occupational group, 2016 and projected 2026 (Numbers in thousands) [1]. 
Tech employees are compensated nicely due to this tech boom. For example, in 207 while the annual medialn wage for all occupations was $37,000 in the U.S., it was $84,600 for the computer occupations, second only to $102,000 of the management occupations as shown in Table 1.

# Correlation Between the CHCI and the Median House Income of Los Angeles County Zip Codes
<br>
Fig. 8 shows the association between the 2012 CHCI and the 2016 median household income of 282 zip codes in L.A. County. We can see a **very strong correlation** correlation between the human capital level [23] and the household income for the zip code in L.A. It demonstrates the importance to invest in education (chci) in order to create more productive workforce and more high paying jobs.

# Conclusions

* Gender imbalance continues (Fig. 1)
* BRICS to outnumber Western countries by 2020 (Fig. 6)
* User prevalence moderatedly-correlated with innovation (Fig. 8)

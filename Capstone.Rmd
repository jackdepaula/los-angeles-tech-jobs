# Correlation Between the CHCI and the Median House Income of Los Angeles County Zip Codes
<br>
Fig. 8 shows the association between the 2012 CHCI and the 2016 median household income of 282 zip codes in L.A. County. We can see a **very strong correlation** correlation between the human capital level [23] and the household income for the zip code in L.A. It demonstrates the importance to invest in education (chci) in order to create more productive workforce and more high paying jobs.
